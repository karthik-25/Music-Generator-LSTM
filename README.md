# Music Generation with Deep Learning

This project explores the fascinating intersection of artificial intelligence and music by employing deep learning techniques to generate musical sequences. Utilizing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) optimized for learning long-term dependencies, the goal was to model and generate musical notes based on a corpus of music. For this project, a collection of piano MIDI files were used from the MAESTRO dataset.
